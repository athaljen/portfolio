              At SilverSky Technology, I've spent nearly 2 years as a Frontend
              Developer, making a significant impact across 20+ projects in
              eCommerce, healthcare, and government sectors. Collaborated
              closely with product managers and QA to deliver seamless, bug-free
              applications on time. Led and mentored a team of interns, guiding
              them to become production-ready.

              During my virtual internship with Eduskills, in collaboration with
              Blue Prism, I gained hands-on experience in Robotic Process
              Automation (RPA). I successfully designed automated workflows,
              streamlined repetitive tasks, and enhanced process efficiency. I
              also worked on projects, applying Blue Prism tools to real-world
              scenarios, strengthening my problem-solving and analytical skills
              in automation.
